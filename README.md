# Python-and-Pandas-for-Data-Science-Productivity
Though Pandas is the reason I started, I realized, it is important to introduce Python properly to appreciate the full collection of concepts and computational thinking

My purpose is to have a reposity where Python and Pandas for Data Science Productivity are focussed.  It should be easier to connect to data science ideas and Pandas is great for that.
However, it is not complete unless we understand the foundations of python also. 

So here is an attempt. 

I will be posting every day a concept, clarifications, or notes on Python and Pandas until it covers the all essential foundations and Pandas.

The Python foundations are: 

* Python 1: Introducing Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Magic commands, shortcuts
* Python 2: Introduction to Python - Data Structures for Data Science
* Python 3: Conditional Expressions
* Python 4: Loops
* Python 5: Computations with - Lists
* Python 6: Computations with - Strings
* Python 7: Computations with - Dictionaries
* Python 8: Tuples and sets
* Python 9: Functions
* Python 10: Functions - Global variables, variable number of arguments in a function, unpack tuples and dictionaries as arguments, lambda functions, map, filter
* Python 11: Iterators and generators
* Python 12: File Handling
* Python 13: Directory Management
* Python 14: Workting with CSV, TXT, DAT, SAS, R, STATA files
* Python 15: Support functions - data compression functions, process management, threads
* Python 16: Date, Time functions 

The presentation may not be exactly in this order. 

On the Pandas side, I will be covering the following

(The arrangement of the list is from [ThePointer.com](https://thispointer.com/pandas-skip-rows-while-reading-csv-file-to-a-dataframe-using-read_csv-in-python/)

However, as you perhaps see, the notes that I walk you through the labyrinth will be in my way of taking you around with the goal that there is a consistency to think about these.

And, so it is easier to own it and above all remember them.
